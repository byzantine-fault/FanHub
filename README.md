# ðŸ’ž FanHub - Where Creators Meet Fans

A revolutionary anonymous social platform enabling authentic creator-fan connections through token-gated communities, powered by Oasis Sapphire with ROFL.

## Overview

FanHub transforms the creator-fan relationship by providing an exclusive, secure space where meaningful connections thrive. Through our innovative token-gating system, fans can join private communities by holding creator tokens, enabling direct and anonymous interactions with their favorite creators.

### Key Features:

- **Exclusive Creator Spaces**: Access private communities by holding creator tokens
- **Anonymous Interactions**: Maintain privacy while engaging with creators
- **Token-Powered Access**: Fair and transparent community participation
- **Secure Environment**: End-to-end encrypted messaging for all communications
- **Direct Creator Access**: Genuine interactions in a controlled space

## How It Works

FanHub is a decentralized chat application that provides:

1. **Token Gated Group Chats**: Create groups that require members to hold specific token amounts on supported chains to join
2. **Direct Messaging**: Send encrypted messages directly to other users
3. **E2E Encryption**: All messages are encrypted using Oasis Sapphire's confidential smart contracts
4. **ROFL Integration**: Automated token balance verification using ROFL (Remote Offchain Fault-tolerant Logic)

The application consists of:

- Smart contracts deployed on Oasis Sapphire
- ROFL application for off-chain token balance verification
- Next.js frontend with Wagmi for web3 integration
